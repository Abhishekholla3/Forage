# Forage
Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation (2024)
This project involved participating in the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage. During this simulation, I acted as a Data Analyst for a hypothetical social media client.

Tasks Performed:

Cleaned and prepared 7 datasets using techniques to handle missing values and identify outliers.
Modeled the data to facilitate analysis.
Performed data analysis to uncover trends in content performance.
Created charts and graphs to communicate key findings.

Outcomes:
The analysis revealed insights into audience preferences and content engagement. Based on these insights, I recommended strategies to optimize content creation and improve social media reach.
